Portfolio Robin Lindeboom

Welcome to the personal GitHub page of Robin Lindeboom. This page is made in accordance to the guidelines of the elective minor Applied Data Science (ADS), provided by the Faculty of Information Technology and Design at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. Below you may find my personal development during the above mentioned minor. Within this minor I take part in the research group 'Pepper'. Pepper conducts a research about the usage of a thee-dimensional camera in healthcare. The research question is as follows: *Is a physical therapist able to detect a painful arc among patients with assistance of a three-dimensional camera?*


# **Datacamp**
